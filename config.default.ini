# General settings
[General]

# The program to perform the actual stress test
# The following programs are available:
# - PRIME95
# - AIDA64
# - YCRUNCHER
# You can change the test mode for each program in the relavant [sections] below.
# Note: For AIDA64, you need to manually download and extract the portable ENGINEER version and put it
#       in the /test_programs/aida64/ folder
# Note: AIDA64 is somewhat sketchy as well
# Default: PRIME95
stressTestProgram = PRIME95


# Set the runtime per core
# You can define a specific runtime per core, by entering a numeric value in seconds,
# or use 'h' for hours, 'm' for minutes and 's' for seconds
# Examples: 360 = 360 seconds
#           1h4m = 1 hour, 4 minutes
#           1.5m = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
#
# Automatic runtime:
# You can also set it to "auto", in which case it will perform one full run of all the FFT sizes in the selected
# Prime95 preset for each core, and when that is finished, it continues to the next core and starts again
# For y-Cruncher the "auto" setting will wait until all selected tests have been finished for a core
# and will then continue to the next core
# For Aida64 the "auto" setting will default to 10 Minutes per core
#
# Below are some examples of the runtime for one iteration for the various tests on my 5900X with one thread
# The first iteration is also usually the fastest one
# Selecting two threads usually takes *much* longer than one thread for one iteration in Prime95
# - Prime95 "Smallest":     4K to   21K - [SSE] ~3-4 Minutes   <|> [AVX] ~8-9 Minutes    <|> [AVX2] ~8-10 Minutes
# - Prime95 "Small":       36K to  248K - [SSE] ~4-6 Minutes   <|> [AVX] ~14-19 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~14-19 Minutes
# - Prime95 "Large":      426K to 8192K - [SSE] ~18-22 Minutes <|> [AVX] ~37-44 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~38-51 Minutes
# - Prime95 "Huge":      8960K to   MAX - [SSE] ~13-19 Minutes <|> [AVX] ~27-40 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~33-51 Minutes
# - Prime95 "All":          4K to   MAX - [SSE] ~40-65 Minutes <|> [AVX] ~92-131 Minutes <|> [AVX2] ~102-159 Minutes
# - Prime95 "Moderate":  1344K to 4096K - [SSE] ~7-15 Minutes  <|> [AVX] ~17-30 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~17-33 Minutes
# - Prime95 "Heavy":        4K to 1344K - [SSE] ~15-28 Minutes <|> [AVX] ~43-68 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~47-73 Minutes
# - Prime95 "HeavyShort":   4K to  160K - [SSE] ~6-8 Minutes   <|> [AVX] ~22-24 Minutes  <|> [AVX2] ~23-25 Minutes
# - y-Cruncher: ~10 Minutes
# Default: 6m

# Setting this to 1 will periodically suspend the stress test program, wait for a bit, and then resume it
# You should see the CPU load and clock speed drop significantly while the program is suspended and rise back up again
# Note: This will increase the runtime of the various stress tests as seen in the "runtimePerCore" setting by roughly 10%
# Default: 1
suspendPeriodically = 1


# The test order of the cores
# Available modes:
# Default:    On CPUs with more than 8 physical cores: 'Alternate'. Otherwise 'Random'
# Alternate:  Alternate between the 1st core on CCD1, then 1st on CCD2, then 2nd on CCD1, then 2nd on CCD2, etc.
#             This should distribute the heat more evenly and possibly allow for higher clocks on CPUs with 2 CCDs
# Random:     A random order
# Sequential: Cycle through the cores in numerical order
#
# You can also define your own testing order by entering a list of comma separated values.
# The list will be processed as provided, which means you can test the same core multiple times per iteration.
# Do note however that the "coresToIgnore" setting still takes precedence over any core listed here.
# The enumeration of cores starts with 0
# Example: 5, 4, 0, 5, 5, 7, 2
#
# Default: Default

# Stop the whole testing process if an error occurred
# If set to 0 (default), the stress test programm will be restarted when an error
# occurs and the core that caused the error will be skipped in the next iteration
# Default: 0
stopOnError = 0


# The number of threads to use for testing
# You can only choose between 1 and 2
# If Hyperthreading / SMT is disabled, this will automatically be set to 1
# Currently there's no automatic way to determine which core has thrown an error
# Setting this to 1 causes higher boost clock speed (due to less heat)
# Default: 1
# Maximum: 2
numberOfThreads = 1


# Use only one thread for load generation, but assign the affinity to both virtual (logical) cores
# This way the Windows Scheduler should bounce the load back and forth between the two virtual cores
# This may lead to additional stress situation otherwise not possible
# This setting has no effect if Hyperthreading / SMT is disabled or if numberOfThreads = 2
# Default: 0
assignBothVirtualCoresForSingleThread = 0


# The max number of iterations

# Restart the stress test process when a new core is selected
# This means each core will perform the same sequence of tests during the stress test
# Note: The monitor doesn't seem to turn off when this setting is enabled
#
# Important note:
# One disadvantage of this setting is that it has the potential to limit the amount of tests that the stress test program
# can run.
# In Prime95 for example, each FFT size will run for roughly 1 minute (except for very small ones), so if you want to make
# sure that Prime95 runs all of the available FFT sizes for a setting, you'll have to extend the "runtimePerCore" setting
# from the default value to something higher.
# For example the "Huge"/SSE preset has 19 FFT entries, and tests on my 5900X showed that it roughly takes 13-19 Minutes
# until all FFT sizes have been tested. The "Large"/SSE seems to take between 18 and 22 Minutes.
# I've included the measured times in the comment for the "runtimePerCore" setting above.
#
# If this setting is disabled, there's a relatively high chance that each core will eventually pass through all of the
# FFT sizes since Prime95 doesn't stop between the cores and so it evens out after time.
#
# Default: 0
restartTestProgramForEachCore = 0


# Set a delay between the cores
# If the "restartTestProgramForEachCore" flag is set, this setting will define the amount of seconds between the end of the

# Default: 15
