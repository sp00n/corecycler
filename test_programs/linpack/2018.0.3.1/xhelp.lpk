Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark extended help information

About Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark (shared-memory version):

Shared-memory (SMP) version of Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark
is a generalization of the LINPACK* 1000 benchmark which solves a dense
(real*8) system of linear equations (Ax=b), measures the amount of time it
takes to factor and solve the system, converts that time into a performance
rate and tests the results for accuracy.  The generalization is in the number
of equations (N) we can solve, which is not limited to 1000. We use partial 
pivoting to assure the accuracy of the results. This benchmark should not be 
used to report LINPACK* 1000 performance as that is a compiled-code only benchmark.
This is a shared-memory implementation which runs on a single platform and should
not be confused with MP LINPACK* or HPL*, which is a distributed memory version 
of the same benchmark.  This benchmark should not be confused with LINPACK*,
the library, which has been expanded upon by LAPACK the library.

Binaries and the running environment.

Shared-memory (SMP) version of Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark
uses these names for the executables to be run:
        linpack_xeon32.exe            Windows*, Intel(R) Xeon(R) 32-bit
        linpack_xeon64.exe            Windows*, Intel(R) Xeon(R) 64-bit, supports
                                                Automatic Offload mode
        xlinpack_xeon32               Linux*, Intel(R) Xeon(R) 32-bit
        xlinpack_xeon64               Linux*, Intel(R) Xeon(R) 64-bit, supports
                                              Automatic Offload mode
        linpack_cd32                  macOS*, Intel(R) Core(TM) microarchitecture 32-bit
        linpack_cd64                  macOS*, Intel(R) Core(TM) microarchitecture 64-bit

The name 'linpack' stands for any of these binaries below in the text of this
extended help information. 'the benchmark' shall stand for this shared-memory (SMP)
version of Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark. Which of these binaries
will be present in the package depends on which package was installed.

The benchmark makes use of SMP parallelism and by default generates as many
threads of execution as the number of the processors of the SMP system. One can
override the default number of threads by setting the environment variable
OMP_NUM_THREADS to any positive number. Note that performance is usually
maximized when the number of the threads is equal to the number of cores (so,
for a two socket dual-core system, 4 would be ideal).

Usage:

linpack
linpack -h[elp]
linpack -e[xtended_help]
linpack [-i[nput_file]] data_file
linpack < data_file

Here is an explanation for the options.

linpack
        when used without options, the benchmark prints this prompt
                Input data or print help ? Type [data]/help :
        and waits for the input. If 'help' was typed, it prints brief usage
        information (just like a 'linpack -h[elp]' form) and quits. Otherwise,
        be ready to input data for a run of the benchmark. Enter the 4 numbers on the
        following prompts:
                Number of equations to solve (problem size):
                Leading dimension of array:
                Number of trials to run:
                Data alignment value (in Kbytes):
        See notes on the input data below.
        The output will contain the system information, input data and test results.
        See notes on the output data format below.
        The "linpack_cd32" will hang without a data file.

linpack -h[elp]
        prints brief usage information and quits

linpack -e[xtended_help]
        prints this extended help information and quits

linpack [-i[nput_file]] data_file
linpack < data_file
        makes the benchmark run with the input data contained in 'data_file'.
   The benchmark allows a user to either enter data manually or with a data file.
   Manual data can be provided when the benchmark is executed with no arguments.
   Below we provide a sample of the data file format and give a brief description of
   its contents.

        Data file format description:
        Line 1 is discarded.
        Line 2 is printed on the standard output as it is.
        Line 3 begins with the number of tests, must be non-negative.
        Lines 4, 5, 6, 7 contain the values of the four specified parameters
        (a number of equations, a leading dimension, times to run a test, alignment
        value in KBytes) for each of the tests. The number of the values on each
        line from 4 to 7 must be no less than the number of tests.
        Note that in the current version of the benchmark the number of tests is
        restricted by 32, so only the first 32 tests will be performed if the
        greater number of the tests is specified.
        See the notes on the input data values and the output data format below.

Notes on the input data values for a shared-memory (SMP) version of 
  Intel(R) Distribution for LINPACK* Benchmark

Every test of the benchmark is defined by the 4 input parameters values:
        Number of equations to solve (problem size)
        Leading dimension of array
        Number of trials to run
        Data alignment value (in Kbytes)
One can set no more than 1 test per an executable run in case of manual
input (with 'linpack' usage), or up to 32 tests in case of the package form
input (with 'linpack ... data_file' usage). The rules for every test's set
are as follows.
The number of equations must be positive, this value (with the couple of the
leading dimension value) is restricted only by the memory available. The benchmark
solves a real*8 system of linear equations; just to store the matrix
requires at least 8*(leading dimension)*(number of equations) bytes.  Each
test or trial may have a different memory requirement, but the program may
exit if given a leading dimension and number of equations too large.
The leading dimension must be no less than the number of equations.
Experience has shown that the best performance for a given problem size
is obtained when the leading dimension is set to the nearest odd
multiple of 8 (16 for Intel(R) AVX processors) equal to or larger
than the number of equations (divisible by 8 but not by 16, or
divisible by 16 but not 32 for Intel(R) AVX processors).
Two other input values must be non-negative.
The number of trials determines how many runs with the same initial data
will be accomplished repeatedly.
The alignment value allows the arrays to be aligned to the value specified,
zero means that no specific alignment will be performed - the arrays are
used as they are allocated.
The best performance is likely to be obtained when arrays are aligned to
the page size boundary.

Notes on Creating the Input Data files

The product is released with sample data files.  These are set up to
provide good performance numbers with an ideal memory configuration.
Users may find that their memory configuration is smaller than the
predefined inputs.  In this event, take a sample data file as described
above.  Note that the most significant part is determining the largest
problem size.  While the above text talks to problem sizes and how they
match memory, here we will walk through an example.
Suppose the target machine only has 4 GBytes of memory (and assuming that
OS allows one to do a malloc of size 4 GB as well.)  Note that
22000*22000*8 is 3.872 billion bytes, which is close to the maximum
malloc size.  We can try a problem size of 22000 interactively first.
If this is an Intel(R) Itanium(R) 2 processor, we find that a leading dimension
of 22000 is a wise choice (hence 22000*22000*8).  There will be another
things resident in memory, so 22000 may not fit.  If not, we can back
off to 21000, or some other value as the largest problem.

For example, in a sample run of 5000, we observe on the output line (see below):

        Maximum memory requested that can be used = 200104096, at the size = 5000

This corresponds to the actual size in bytes of the malloc performed by
the benchmark and can be used to help guide the calculation of the
largest problem.
Once one has the largest problem, it is easier to fill out the rest of the
data file given the information above.
