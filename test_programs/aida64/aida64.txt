There are no files here because AIDA64 is not a free program and I'm not sure I'm allowed to provide it as part of this script.
You can get AIDA64 here: https://www.aida64.com/downloads

!! IMPORTANT !!
You NEED to get the PORTABLE ENGINEER version and extract the zip file into this directory (not within a sub directory, so the binary aida64.exe should be directly here).
The trial version is available for 30 days.

The "regular" EXTREME version will NOT work, you NEED the ENGINEER one (or theoretically Business and Network Audit will also work, but I haven't tested this).
