A CLI tool for the ZenStates SMU library. See ZenStates-Core for compatibility.

Requires .NET Framework 8.

All credit to irusanov, who wrote ZenStates-Core on which this depends for all meaningful functionality, and SMUDebugTool for usage examples.

Usage:

.\ryzen-smu-cli.exe --help
Description:
  A CLI for the Ryzen SMU.

Usage:
  ryzen-smu-cli [options]

Options:
  --offset <offset>                  Specify a zero-indexed logical core, or list of logical cores, and their PBO
                                     offset(s), in a fashion similar to taskset. e.g. 0:-10,1:5,2:-20,14:-25. These are
                                     the logical core IDs as they appear in your system, not the true IDs according to
                                     fused hardware disabled cores. Alternatively, you may supply a simpler
                                     comma-separated list of offset values - e.g. 0,-14,-30,5,-10,-22 - but, obviously,
                                     this can only set the value on up to X core that you define.
  --disable-cores <disable-cores>    Specify a zero-indexed list of logical cores to disable. e.g. 0,1,4,7,12,15. This
                                     setting does not take into account any current core disablement. All cores you
                                     wish to disable must be specified. Any that are unspecified will be enabled. This
                                     option requires a reboot.
  --enable-all-cores                 Enable all cores.
  --get-offsets-terse                Print a list of all PBO offsets on logical cores in a simple, comma-separated
                                     format, without core identifiers. e.g. -15,0,2,-20. Note that you cannot retrieve
                                     the offsets from disabled cores.
  --get-physical-cores               Print a list of physical cores, to find out which ones are disabled in
                                     <8-core-per-CCD SKUs.
  --get-enabled-cores                Print a list of logically enabled/disabled cores, and their relationship to the
                                     physical cores, inclusive of factory-fused disabled cores.
  --set-pbo-scalar <set-pbo-scalar>  Sets the PBO scalar. This is a whole number between 1 and 10.
  --get-pbo-scalar                   Get the current PBO scalar.
  --version                          Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                     Show help and usage information



Usage in CoreCycler
